The finite fault solution indicates a north striking right-lateral fault. This focal mechanism and finite fault solution are consistent with the earthquake potentially [...] occurring on the right-lateral Sagaing Fault that lies in the fault zone that defines the plate boundary between the Indian and Sunda plates.\n",
